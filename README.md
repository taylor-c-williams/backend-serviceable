### Learning Objectives[](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/backend-serviceable/#learning-objectives)

-   Describe the service layer's responsibilities
-   Find existing solutions for common problems and evaluate features & compatibilities
-   Demonstrate using a third-party service in a backend API
-   Explain how to use a third-party service using information gathered via documentation & research

### Description[](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/backend-serviceable/#description)

You'll be splitting into groups of 2-3 for this deliverable. Your task is to build an example/proof of concept that uses a third-party service. You can choose any service you've been curious about or might seem useful in a project.

Some examples of third-party services include:

-   Sending emails using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
-   Sending text messages using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) or [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
-   Use [Open Library's APIs](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to create a virtual bookshelf of book & author information, with custom notes & descriptions
-   Calculate metrics for crypto currencies using the [Blockchain.com APIs](https://www.blockchain.com/api)
-   Use machine learning and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models) to determine if a submitted comment is perceived as "very toxic" or "very healthy"
-   Use [NASA's APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) to determine when the next potentially hazardous asteroid will be approaching Earth, then send an email/text message with the asteroid's information
-   Use [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/developers/pre-trained-models), [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision), or [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) to perform image analysis like emotion detection, text recognition, or celebrity identification

After building your proof of concept, you'll write a description of the service you used, how you used it, and other potential use-cases where you might use the service again. Include a pros/cons list of the service based on your evaluation.

-   Is it well-documented?
-   Is it well-supported?
-   Is it widely used? (Things you might check: GitHub stars/watchers, search engine results, recent updates)
-   Is it intuitive to use?
-   What is the most interesting/exciting thing you discovered about the service?
-   What could be improved?

### Acceptance Criteria[](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/backend-serviceable/#acceptance-criteria)

-   Link to GitHub repo of an example/proof of concept
-   A paragraph explaining the service(s) and third-party APIs used# Rubric[](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/backend-serviceable/#rubric)

| Task | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Proof of Concept | 5 |
| Explanation | 5
